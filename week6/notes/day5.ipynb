    "# Day 5 - Fine-Tuning LLMs with OpenAI: Preparing Data, Training, and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text outlines the process of fine-tuning frontier AI models, particularly using OpenAI's platform, emphasizing that this \"training\" is actually an adaptation of pre-trained models through transfer learning. It details a practical three-step workflow: preparing data in the specific JSONL format, executing the fine-tuning while monitoring loss metrics, and then evaluating the model's performance for iterative improvement, all crucial for customizing powerful AI for specific real-world data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Fine-tuning Leverages Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuning is presented as the practical method for training large models, involving additional training on a pre-existing, extensively trained model. This is distinct from the economically unfeasible task of training such models from scratch and is essential for adapting models to new, specific tasks.\n",
    "-   **JSONL Format for Training Data:** OpenAI requires training data to be in JSONL (JSON Lines) format. Each line in a JSONL file must be a distinct JSON object, typically containing a \"messages\" array that represents a conversation (a sequence of role and content dictionaries). This specific formatting is critical for the data to be correctly ingested and used in the fine-tuning process.\n",
    "-   **Iterative Three-Step Fine-Tuning Process:** The core process involves (1) preparing and uploading appropriately formatted training data, (2) running the fine-tuning job while carefully monitoring performance metrics like training loss, and (3) evaluating the resulting model and iteratively tweaking the process. This structured approach is fundamental to achieving desired model behaviors.\n",
    "-   **Monitoring Training and Validation Loss:** A key aspect of the training phase is observing the training loss to ensure it decreases, indicating learning. While validation loss (on a separate, unseen dataset) is typically used to monitor for overfitting, the speaker notes that with a very large dataset and a single training epoch, training loss can serve a similar indicative purpose.\n",
    "-   **Understanding Epochs in Training:** An epoch refers to one complete pass of the training algorithm over the entire training dataset. The strategy discussed involves using a single epoch due to the large volume of training data, implying that each piece of data the model sees is new, making training loss a more direct measure of learning on new examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Training Loss vs. Validation Loss**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Distinguishing between training loss (model error on data it's trained on) and validation loss (model error on unseen data) is vital for diagnosing model performance. It helps identify overfitting, where the model memorizes training data but fails to generalize to new data, or underfitting, where the model performs poorly on both.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In any machine learning project, these metrics guide critical decisions such as when to stop training, whether to adjust model architecture, or if more diverse data is needed. This ensures the developed model will be reliable and effective when deployed in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** To better manage and interpret these losses, one should explore concepts like regularization (e.g., L1/L2, dropout), cross-validation strategies, the analysis of learning curves, and understanding the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Single-Epoch Training with Large Datasets**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** This strategy suggests that for fine-tuning with extremely large and diverse datasets, a single pass (one epoch) through the data might be sufficient for the model to learn the desired task-specific nuances. This can challenge the conventional wisdom of needing multiple epochs, especially when each data point in that single epoch is effectively \"new\" to the model during that pass.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In enterprise-scale data science projects where vast amounts of data are available for fine-tuning (e.g., large customer interaction logs, extensive domain-specific text corpora), a single-epoch strategy can lead to significant savings in computational cost and training time without compromising the model's ability to adapt.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Data pipeline efficiency, online learning (where models learn incrementally from a continuous stream of data), batch size selection, and data sampling techniques are important related areas to ensure the single epoch is as effective as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from this fine-tuning concept using JSONL conversational data? Provide a one‑sentence explanation.\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* A project aimed at creating a specialized medical diagnosis assistant could benefit by fine-tuning a model on a JSONL dataset of anonymized doctor-patient consultation transcripts to improve its understanding of medical jargon and conversational flow in a clinical context.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the purpose of fine-tuning a large language model to a junior colleague, using one concrete example? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* Think of a large pre-trained model as a highly educated generalist; fine-tuning is like sending them to a specialist school, for instance, taking a general writing AI and fine-tuning it with legal documents to make it proficient in drafting contracts.\n",

    "# Day 5 - How to Prepare JSONL Files for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text provides a detailed walkthrough of the data preparation phase for fine-tuning an OpenAI model, executed within a Jupyter Lab environment. It covers the practical steps from selecting an appropriate number of training examples (using 500, more than the minimum recommendation due to small example size), structuring these examples into the required conversational JSONL format using custom Python functions, and then programmatically writing these to files. Finally, it demonstrates uploading these structured data files to OpenAI's platform via their API, ensuring correct parameters like binary file mode and 'fine-tune' purpose are used, thereby readying the data for the subsequent model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Strategic Data Sizing for Fine-Tuning:** The approach involves selecting 500 training examples and 50 validation examples, exceeding OpenAI's minimum recommendation (50-100). This decision is justified by the small size of individual text examples, suggesting that a larger number of concise examples can be more beneficial for the model to learn specific patterns, like price estimation, effectively.\n",
    "-   **Custom Python Functions for JSONL Generation:** The process heavily relies on Python functions to transform raw data into the precise JSONL format required by OpenAI. Functions like `messages_for` structure individual data points into a conversational format (system, user, assistant messages), `make_jsonl` compiles these into a single string with newline-separated JSON objects, and `write_jsonl` saves this string to a file.\n",
    "-   **Conversational Format for Training Examples:** Each training instance is meticulously crafted into a \"messages\" array. This includes a system prompt defining the AI's role (\"You estimate prices of items, reply only with the price, no explanation\"), a user prompt derived from the item's description, and an assistant's response providing the target price. This structured conversational data is key to effective fine-tuning.\n",
    "-   **Adherence to JSONL Specifications:** The output `.jsonl` files consist of multiple lines, where each line is an independent, complete JSON object. This is distinct from a standard JSON file that might contain a single JSON array or object spanning multiple lines. This specific format is crucial for OpenAI's fine-tuning ingestion process.\n",
    "-   **API for File Upload:** The `OpenAI.files.create` method is used to upload the generated training and validation JSONL files to OpenAI's servers. This step transitions the locally prepared data to the cloud platform where fine-tuning will occur.\n",
    "-   **Binary File Mode (`'rb'`) for Uploads:** A critical technical detail for the upload process is opening the JSONL files in binary read mode (`'rb'`). This ensures the file bytes are streamed correctly to the API without unintended encoding or modification, which is essential for preserving data integrity.\n",
    "-   **Specifying File Purpose as 'fine-tune':** When uploading files via the API, the `purpose` parameter is explicitly set to `'fine-tune'`. This informs the OpenAI platform about the intended use of these files, enabling their correct handling within the fine-tuning workflow.\n",
    "-   **Inclusion of a Validation Set:** Although the described training strategy uses a single epoch where training loss can be very indicative, a separate validation set is prepared and uploaded. This demonstrates best practice, allowing for robust evaluation and overfitting checks in more general fine-tuning scenarios.\n",
    "-   **Confirmation of File Processing:** After uploading, the API response includes a file object with a status, such as `'processed'`. This confirmation is important to verify that OpenAI has successfully received and preliminarily validated the uploaded data files before initiating a fine-tuning job.\n",
    "-   **Cost-Effectiveness of Fine-Tuning:** The transcript notes that the cost for fine-tuning with this number of examples is minimal (on the order of cents), and at the time of recording, was even temporarily free. This low barrier to entry makes fine-tuning accessible for a wide range of users and projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Binary File Upload (`'rb'`) for OpenAI API**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** When uploading files to web APIs like OpenAI's, sending the raw byte stream is often necessary. Using `'rb'` (read binary) mode in Python for opening files ensures that the file's content is read byte-for-byte, without any interpretation or modification based on text encodings (e.g., UTF-8) or line ending conversions that might occur in text mode (`'r'`). This prevents data corruption during transit.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This practice is standard for many file upload operations to cloud services or APIs, whether for machine learning datasets, images, or other binary data. Incorrectly handling file modes can lead to persistent upload failures or subtle data corruption that negatively impacts downstream processes like model training.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Understanding Python's file I/O modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'rb'`, `'wb'`, etc.), character encodings (ASCII, UTF-8), the structure of HTTP requests involving file uploads (often `multipart/form-data`), and general API client best practices are all relevant for robustly interacting with such services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The following are conceptual representations of the Python code described for data preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structuring a single training example (`messages_for` function concept):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def messages_for(item_data):\n",
    "        system_prompt = \"You estimate prices of items, reply only with the price, no explanation.\"\n",
    "        user_prompt = f\"How much does this cost? {item_data['description']}\" # Simplified\n",
    "        assistant_response = f\"Price is ${item_data['price']}\"\n",
    "        return [\n",
    "            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n",
    "            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt},\n",
    "            {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": assistant_response},\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Creating the JSONL string content (`make_jsonl` function concept):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import json\n",
    "\n",
    "    def make_jsonl(items_dataset):\n",
    "        jsonl_string = \"\"\n",
    "        for item in items_dataset:\n",
    "            formatted_messages = messages_for(item) # Using the function above\n",
    "            # Each entry must have a \"messages\" key\n",
    "            json_object_string = json.dumps({\"messages\": formatted_messages})\n",
    "            jsonl_string += json_object_string + \"\\n\"\n",
    "        return jsonl_string.strip() # Remove trailing newline\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Writing JSONL content to a file (`write_jsonl` function concept):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def write_jsonl(items_dataset, file_name):\n",
    "        jsonl_content = make_jsonl(items_dataset)\n",
    "        with open(file_name, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: # Write in text mode initially\n",
    "            f.write(jsonl_content)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Uploading the JSONL file to OpenAI (`OpenAI.files.create` call):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from openai import OpenAI\n",
    "    client = OpenAI() # Assuming API key is set in environment\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Example for training file\n",
    "    file_path = \"fine_tune_train.jsonl\"\n",
    "    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f: # Must open in binary read mode 'rb'\n",
    "        training_file_response = client.files.create(\n",
    "            file=f,\n",
    "            purpose=\"fine-tune\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    print(f\"Training file uploaded: {training_file_response.id}, Status: {training_file_response.status}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Example for validation file (similar process)\n",
    "    validation_file_path = \"fine_tune_validation.jsonl\"\n",
    "    with open(validation_file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n",
    "        validation_file_response = client.files.create(\n",
    "            file=f,\n",
    "            purpose=\"fine-tune\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    print(f\"Validation file uploaded: {validation_file_response.id}, Status: {validation_file_response.status}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** How could the `messages_for` function be adapted if you were fine-tuning a model to summarize news articles instead of estimating prices?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* The system prompt would be \"You are an expert summarizer. Provide a concise summary of the following news article.\" The user message would contain the full text of the news article, and the assistant message would contain the ideal, human-written summary for that article.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** You need to explain to a junior data scientist why each line in a JSONL file must be a separate, complete JSON object for OpenAI fine-tuning. How would you phrase this?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* Think of each line in the JSONL file as a distinct postcard with a full message (a training example) that OpenAI's system picks up one by one to read and learn from; if the \"postcard\" isn't complete or properly formatted on its own, the system can't process that specific example correctly.\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** After successfully uploading the training and validation files and receiving their `file_id`s, what is the immediate next API call you would make to OpenAI to actually start the fine-tuning process, and what key parameters would it require?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* The next step is to call `client.fine_tuning.jobs.create()`, which would require parameters such as `training_file=\"YOUR_TRAINING_FILE_ID\"`, `validation_file=\"YOUR_VALIDATION_FILE_ID\"`, and `model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"` (or another compatible base model for fine-tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Day 5 - Step-by-Step Guide: Launching GPT Fine-Tuning Jobs with OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text describes the process of initiating and monitoring an OpenAI fine-tuning job, highlighting the optional but beneficial integration with Weights & Biases for real-time visualization of training metrics. It focuses on the `OpenAI.fine_tuning.jobs.create` API call, detailing essential parameters like training/validation file IDs, model selection (e.g., a smaller, cost-effective GPT model), and hyperparameters like `n_epochs`. Furthermore, it explains how to track the asynchronous job's progress by retrieving its status and listing associated events, preparing for the observation of the actual training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Weights & Biases (W&B) for Visualization:** The use of Weights & Biases is recommended for monitoring fine-tuning jobs. By integrating a W&B API key with an OpenAI account, users can visualize metrics like loss curves in real-time, providing valuable insights into the training dynamics. This is an optional enhancement.\n",
    "-   **Initiating Fine-Tuning via API:** The core step to start training is calling `OpenAI.fine_tuning.jobs.create()`. This function takes various parameters to define and configure the fine-tuning task on OpenAI's infrastructure.\n",
    "-   **Key Parameters for `jobs.create()`:** Essential parameters include `training_file` (the ID of the uploaded training data), `validation_file` (ID of the validation data, for good practice), `model` (the base model to fine-tune, e.g., `MODEL_GPT_MINI` representing a specific fine-tunable GPT variant), and a `seed` for ensuring reproducible results.\n",
    "-   **Hyperparameter Configuration (`n_epochs`):** The `hyperparameters` argument allows specifying training controls, such as `n_epochs`. In the example, `n_epochs` is set to 1, based on the strategy of using a large dataset once rather than repeating epochs with less data.\n",
    "-   **Custom Naming with `suffix`:** An optional `suffix` parameter can be used to add a custom identifier to the name of the resulting fine-tuned model. This helps in organizing and distinguishing between different model versions created through various experiments.\n",
    "-   **Understanding Hyperparameters:** Hyperparameters are explained as user-configurable settings that control the training process (e.g., number of epochs). \"Hyperparameter optimization\" is described pragmatically as a trial-and-error process to find settings that yield the best model performance.\n",
    "-   **Asynchronous Job Execution:** Fine-tuning jobs are asynchronous. Once a job is created, it runs in the background on OpenAI's servers. The API call returns a job object almost immediately, containing an ID for future reference.\n",
    "-   **Monitoring Job Status:** The status of a fine-tuning job (e.g., pending, running, succeeded) can be retrieved using `OpenAI.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)`.\n",
    "-   **Tracking Progress with Events:** Detailed, step-by-step progress of the fine-tuning job can be observed by calling `OpenAI.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(job_id)`. This provides a log of actions, such as file validation and training iterations.\n",
    "-   **Model Selection Considerations:** The choice of a smaller base model (referred to as `MODEL_GPT_MINI`) for fine-tuning is driven by factors like lower inference cost and potentially comparable performance for the specific task, as observed in prior experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Asynchronous API Operations for Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Fine-tuning large models is computationally intensive and can take a significant amount of time (minutes to hours). Asynchronous API design allows a client to submit a fine-tuning request and receive an immediate acknowledgment (like a job ID) without having to maintain an active connection or wait for the entire process to complete. This non-blocking nature is crucial for efficient application design.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This pattern is common for long-running operations in cloud services, such as batch data processing, video encoding, or training machine learning models. It enables applications to remain responsive and manage resources effectively, allowing users to perform other tasks while the job runs in the background.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Understanding polling mechanisms (periodically checking job status using the ID), webhooks (if supported by the API, for receiving automated notifications upon job completion or status change), job queuing systems, and the general principles of distributed and asynchronous computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Role of `seed` in Training Reproducibility**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Machine learning training often involves elements of randomness (e.g., initial model weights, data shuffling order, dropout layers). Setting a `seed` initializes the pseudo-random number generator to a fixed state. This ensures that if the fine-tuning job is run multiple times with the exact same data, model, and hyperparameters (including the seed), the outcome (e.g., the final model weights and performance metrics) will be identical.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** Reproducibility is vital for debugging training issues, systematically comparing the impact of different hyperparameter settings, validating research findings, and ensuring consistency in production model deployments. Without a fixed seed, it can be difficult to determine if changes in performance are due to deliberate modifications or just random variations.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), stochastic processes in machine learning algorithms, best practices for experiment tracking (logging all parameters, code versions, and data versions), and version control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The following are conceptual Python snippets based on the described process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setting up Weights & Biases Integration (Conceptual):**\n",
    "    This involves UI steps on the W&B and OpenAI platforms. The code part is specifying it in the job creation. If `WANDB_API_KEY` is an environment variable, OpenAI might pick it up automatically when W&B integration is configured in the OpenAI account. The explicit code shown was:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Assuming 'client' is an initialized OpenAI client\n",
    "    # This setup is more about linking your OpenAI account to W&B via their respective UIs.\n",
    "    # The code then references this pre-configured integration.\n",

    "    # client.fine_tuning.integrations.wandb.sync(project=\"Pricer\", name=\"GPT-pricer\")\n",
    "    # However, the primary integration is typically set in the OpenAI dashboard.\n",
    "    # The API call for fine-tuning will then include an 'integrations' parameter.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Creating the Fine-Tuning Job:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",

    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** If you initiate a fine-tuning job and later realize you used the wrong `validation_file` ID, can you change it for the ongoing job? What would be your course of action?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* No, you cannot change parameters like the `validation_file` ID for an ongoing fine-tuning job. The appropriate course of action would be to cancel the current job using `client.fine_tuning.jobs.cancel(job_id)` and then create a new fine-tuning job with the correct validation file ID and other parameters.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain to a stakeholder why setting `n_epochs` to 1 can be a valid strategy when fine-tuning with a very large and diverse dataset of 500 specialized examples, even if typical advice mentions more epochs for smaller datasets?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* With a large and varied set of 500 specialized examples, the model gets to see a rich amount of unique information in just one pass (1 epoch). If each example is distinct and high-quality, this single pass can be sufficient for the model to learn the specific task nuances, making additional passes (epochs) potentially unnecessary and saving training time and cost.\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** When `client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(job_id)` shows the event \"Validating training file\" for an extended period, what could be potential underlying issues with the training file that the system might be checking?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* Extended validation time could indicate several issues: the file might be very large, requiring more time to download and parse; there could be formatting errors in the JSONL structure (e.g., not every line is a valid JSON object, incorrect message structure); or there might be content issues like exceeding token limits per example or inconsistencies flagged by OpenAI's validation logic.\n",

    "# Day 5 - Fine-Tuning LLMs: Track Training Loss & Progress with Weights & Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text discusses the process of monitoring an ongoing OpenAI fine-tuning job, emphasizing the utility of Weights & Biases for visualizing real-time training loss over raw API event logs. It explains common patterns in training loss, such as an initial sharp decrease as the model learns superficial structures, followed by a desired, more gradual improvement. The speaker notes the current run shows high volatility without a clear downward trend yet, highlighting the importance of careful observation throughout the approximately 10-15 minute training process for 500 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Live Training Progress via API Events:** The `list_events` API function allows users to see live updates from the fine-tuning job, including the current training step (e.g., \"step X out of 500\") and the associated `training_loss`. This provides a textual stream of the job's activity.\n",
    "-   **Enhanced Visualization with Weights & Biases:** For a more user-friendly and insightful monitoring experience, integrating with Weights & Biases is highly recommended. It provides graphical representations of metrics like training loss, making it easier to interpret trends and performance in real-time.\n",
    "-   **Interpreting the Initial Loss Drop:** A significant, rapid decrease in training loss during the initial few training steps is typical. This often signifies the model learning basic structural or formatting aspects of the target data (e.g., common punctuation, a dollar sign for prices) rather than complex patterns.\n",
    "-   **Desirable Long-Term Loss Trend:** Following the initial drop, a healthy training process is characterized by a continued, albeit potentially slower and more volatile, downward trend in training loss. This indicates the model is progressively learning the underlying task.\n",
    "-   **Observed Volatility in Current Run:** The speaker notes that the current fine-tuning run, while showing an initial loss drop, is subsequently exhibiting high volatility without a clear sustained downward trend. This observation suggests the model might be struggling to consistently improve across all data points yet.\n",
    "-   **Job Completion and Notification:** The fine-tuning process for the 500 examples is expected to take around 10-15 minutes, after which OpenAI performs validation checks and sends an email notification upon completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Training Loss Dynamics and Interpretation**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Analyzing the behavior of training loss over time is fundamental to understanding how well a machine learning model is learning from the data. It helps diagnose issues such as slow convergence, stagnation, or whether the model is effectively minimizing its errors on the training set.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In practical model development, the training loss curve (often viewed alongside a validation loss curve) guides decisions about the training process. For instance, a flatlining loss might suggest adjusting the learning rate, improving data quality, or changing the model architecture to achieve better performance on the task (e.g., price prediction, text generation).\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Key related areas include understanding different optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, SGD), learning rate schedules, the concepts of overfitting (model learns training data too well but fails on new data) and underfitting (model fails to learn training data adequately), batch size effects, and the importance of validation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "1.  **Checking Training Events (Illustrative):**\n",
    "    The primary way to get textual updates on training progress, including loss per step, is by repeatedly calling `list_events`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Assuming 'client' is an initialized OpenAI client and 'job_id' is known from creating the job.\n",
    "    # job_id = \"ftjob-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" # Replace with your actual job ID\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Get the 10 most recent events\n",
    "        events_response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(job_id=job_id, limit=10)\n",
    "        events = events_response.data\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Print events in chronological order (oldest of the recent first)\n",
    "        for event in reversed(events):\n",
    "            # Timestamps can be converted to human-readable format if needed\n",
    "            # import datetime\n",
    "            # timestamp_datetime = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(event.created_at)\n",
    "            message = event.message\n",
    "            print(f\"At {event.created_at}: {message}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            # Example of extracting step and loss if present in the message\n",
    "            # This parsing is illustrative and depends on the exact message format\n",
    "            if \"Step\" in message and \"loss\" in message:\n",
    "                parts = message.split(',')\n",
    "                step_info = [p for p in parts if \"Step\" in p][0].strip()\n",
    "                loss_info = [p for p in parts if \"loss\" in p][0].strip()\n",
    "                # print(f\"  Parsed: {step_info}, {loss_info}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error retrieving events: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *Note: The actual parsing of step and loss from the `event.message` string would require careful string manipulation or regular expressions, as the format might vary or be complex.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** If your Weights & Biases chart for a fine-tuning job shows training loss decreasing steadily but then suddenly spiking upwards and staying high, what could be a primary reason for this \"catastrophic forgetting\" or divergence in a language model fine-tuning context?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* This could be due to a learning rate that is too high for the later stages of training, causing the optimizer to overshoot minima and diverge, or encountering a batch of particularly noisy or anomalous data that drastically corrupts the learned weights.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain to a business stakeholder, who is looking at a volatile training loss graph on Weights & Biases, why some up-and-down movement is normal and not always a sign of failure?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* \"Think of the model learning like a person practicing a new skill. Sometimes they try different approaches; some work better than others on specific problems they encounter. This up-and-down movement in the graph shows the model exploring and adjusting. As long as the overall trend is downwards, it's learning and improving, much like practice leads to better skill over time despite occasional mistakes.\"\n",

    "# Day 5 - Evaluating Fine-Tuned LLMs Metrics: Analyzing Training & Validation Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text covers the post-completion phase of an OpenAI fine-tuning job, detailing how completion is confirmed via email and API events, and how the unique name of the new fine-tuned model is structured and retrieved. It then delves into analyzing the final training and validation loss charts in Weights & Biases, where a concerning flat or slightly increasing validation loss trend was observed after initial improvements. Finally, the text outlines the setup for evaluating this new model, emphasizing the use of its unique ID in standard API calls and the initiation of tests against a dedicated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Job Completion Confirmation (Email & API):** The successful completion of a fine-tuning job is communicated through an email from OpenAI, which also provides the name of the newly created fine-tuned model. Simultaneously, API event logs (`list_events`) confirm completion through messages like \"Fine tune model created\" and \"Job has been successfully completed.\"\n",
    "-   **Fine-Tuned Model Naming Convention:** The generated fine-tuned model's name follows a specific pattern, e.g., `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal:pricer:ABC123XYZ`, which includes a prefix (`ft`), the base model used, a scope (e.g., `personal`), the user-defined `suffix` (here, `pricer`), and a unique identifier.\n",
    "-   **Retrieving the Fine-Tuned Model ID:** The specific name of the fine-tuned model can be programmatically retrieved from the completed job object using `client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id).fine_tuned_model`. This ID is essential for subsequent use of the model.\n",
    "-   **Post-Training Loss Analysis with Weights & Biases:** After training, Weights & Biases is used to examine the final training and validation loss curves. The speaker notes that the validation loss trend for their single-epoch run appeared somewhat flat or even slightly increasing after initial improvements, which is a point of concern for model generalization.\n",
    "-   **Chart Customization in W&B:** Weights & Biases provides tools to customize charts for better analysis, such as adjusting y-axis scales (zooming) and applying smoothing functions to loss curves, aiding in discerning underlying trends from noisy data.\n",
    "-   **Utilizing the Fine-Tuned Model:** The newly created fine-tuned model is invoked using the standard `client.chat.completions.create` API call. The only modification required is to pass the unique fine-tuned model's name as the `model` parameter.\n",
    "-   **Preparing Data for Evaluation:** Test data inputs are formatted using a similar `messages_for` structure as training data, but crucially, the target answer is omitted from the prompt sent to the model to ensure a fair evaluation.\n",
    "-   **Reusing Utility Functions:** Helper functions, such as `get_price` for extracting numerical price values from the model's textual output, are reused during the evaluation phase.\n",
    "-   **Initial Evaluation and Full Test Set:** A quick test on a single data point indicated a poor prediction by the fine-tuned model. However, the speaker rightly emphasizes that robust evaluation requires testing across a comprehensive dataset (e.g., 250 examples).\n",
    "-   **Iterative Model Development Cycle:** The described process—training, analyzing loss metrics, retrieving the model, and evaluating against test data—forms a critical part of the iterative cycle in machine learning model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Interpreting Validation Loss Trends Post-Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** The validation loss provides insight into how well a fine-tuned model is likely to perform on new, unseen data. A flat or increasing validation loss, especially when training loss is low, is a strong indicator of overfitting, meaning the model has learned the training data too well (including its noise) but has failed to generalize its learning to new instances.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In any practical application, a model must generalize. If validation loss is poor, the model may produce unreliable or incorrect results when deployed. This metric guides decisions on whether the model is suitable for production, or if further iterations (e.g., more diverse data, different hyperparameters, regularization) are needed.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Learning curve analysis (plotting training and validation loss together), diagnosing overfitting and underfitting, regularization techniques (though less directly controllable in some fine-tuning APIs), early stopping strategies (more relevant for multi-epoch training), and methods for improving dataset quality and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **API Endpoint Consistency for Base vs. Fine-Tuned Models**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** OpenAI's design choice to use the same API endpoint (e.g., `client.chat.completions.create`) for both pre-trained base models and user-created fine-tuned models significantly simplifies integration. Developers only need to change the `model` parameter string, rather than implementing entirely different API call structures or client libraries.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This consistency streamlines the transition from using a general-purpose model to a specialized, fine-tuned version within an application. It facilitates A/B testing, staged rollouts, and reduces the engineering effort required to leverage custom models, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Principles of good API design (e.g., uniformity, simplicity), model management and deployment strategies, configuration management in software applications, and versioning of ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "1.  **Retrieving the Fine-Tuned Model Name from a Completed Job:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Assuming 'client' is an initialized OpenAI client and 'job_id' is known\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    def messages_for_testing(item_prompt_text):\n",

    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** If your fine-tuned \"GPT Pricer\" model consistently performs worse on the validation set (as suggested by the flat/increasing validation loss) than your baseline non-fine-tuned `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, what does this suggest about the fine-tuning data or process for this specific task?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* This could suggest that the 500 fine-tuning examples, despite their quantity, might be inadvertently introducing noise, focusing on non-generalizable patterns, or are not diverse enough, leading the model to perform worse than the broadly trained base model. It might also indicate that the task of price prediction from short descriptions is not benefiting significantly from the current style of fine-tuning data, or the base model already captures the necessary signals well.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you simply explain to a non-technical team member why the long string `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal:pricer:ABC123XYZ` is important and what its components signify?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* \"Think of this long string as a unique library card for the special 'Pricer' AI we just trained. 'ft' means it's fine-tuned, 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125' is the original smart AI we started with, 'personal' means it's for our use, 'pricer' is our custom name for this version, and 'ABC123XYZ' is its unique serial number so the system always finds the exact right one.\"\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** Given the potentially concerning validation loss trend, before re-training, what quick, purely analytical step could you take using your existing 50-item validation set and the now-available fine-tuned model to get more insight into *how* it's failing?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* I would run the fine-tuned model on all 50 validation examples, collect its predictions, and then manually compare these predictions against the true prices. This error analysis would involve categorizing common failure modes: Is it consistently too high/low? Is it failing on specific types of items? Does it hallucinate extra text? This qualitative review can provide crucial clues for improving the data or fine-tuning strategy.\n",

    "# Day 5 - LLM Fine-Tuning Challenges: When Model Performance Doesn't Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The evaluation of the fine-tuned model revealed a slightly worse performance on the primary business metric (total price difference) compared to the baseline model, indicating that this specific fine-tuning iteration did not yield the anticipated improvement. Despite this setback on the main metric, the model did exhibit positive changes, such as a notable reduction in predicting extreme outlier prices, by learning from the general range of values in the 500 training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Fine-Tuning Impact on Primary Metric:** The fine-tuned model showed a slight degradation in performance on the key business metric (total difference in price predictions) for the given test set, a result that was disappointing but acknowledged as a possibility.\n",
    "-   **No Overall Degradation, But No Net Benefit on Target Metric:** The outcome suggests that while the model didn't become broadly less capable, the fine-tuning process with 500 examples did not enhance, and in fact slightly hindered, its performance on the specific target evaluation metric.\n",
    "-   **Improvement in Reducing Outliers:** A positive effect of fine-tuning was observed in the model's significantly reduced tendency to predict extreme outlier prices. It learned from the bounded nature of the 500 training examples to make more \"nuanced corrections\" and avoid vastly improbable high values that the previous model version sometimes produced.\n",
    "-   **Lesson on Fine-Tuning Efficacy:** This result serves as a practical reminder that fine-tuning is not a universally guaranteed method for improvement. Its success is highly dependent on the nature of the task, the quality and relevance of the fine-tuning data, the choice of base model, and the specific metrics used for evaluation.\n",
    "-   **Context for Future Learning:** The outcome, termed a \"sobering moment,\" sets the stage for a deeper discussion in subsequent content about the conditions under which fine-tuning frontier models is most beneficial and the reasons it might not always work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Fine-Tuning Efficacy is Not Universal**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** It's critical for data science practitioners to recognize that fine-tuning, despite its potential, does not automatically lead to superior model performance for every task or dataset. Factors like the base model's existing capabilities, the size and quality of the fine-tuning data, its alignment with the target task, and the specific evaluation metrics heavily influence the outcome. Sometimes, a highly capable base model might perform better, or other techniques like prompt engineering or RAG might be more suitable.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This understanding helps in making informed decisions about resource allocation for model improvement. It encourages a thorough cost-benefit analysis before embarking on fine-tuning and underscores the necessity of robust evaluation to determine if fine-tuning truly adds value over simpler or alternative methods. It also manages expectations about the outcomes of fine-tuning experiments.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Comparative analysis of different model adaptation techniques (prompt engineering, RAG, few-shot learning vs. fine-tuning), data preprocessing and augmentation for fine-tuning, strategies for selecting optimal base models, developing comprehensive and multi-faceted evaluation metrics, and understanding task-model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** If your fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis showed slightly lower accuracy on a general news dataset but significantly improved F1-score on identifying subtle sarcasm (a key project goal not well-captured by general accuracy), how would you report the \"success\" of fine-tuning?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* I would report the results transparently, highlighting that while general accuracy saw a minor dip, the fine-tuning was successful in achieving the primary project goal of improving sarcasm detection F1-score, demonstrating the model's enhanced capability on this crucial nuanced aspect.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain to a junior colleague that even if fine-tuning didn't improve the main score, the observed \"reduction in outliers\" is still a valuable piece of information from the experiment?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* \"Even though our main score didn't go up, the fact that the fine-tuned model stopped making those extremely wild, off-base predictions is a win. It tells us the model learned something about the plausible range of answers from our data, making it more stable and predictable in some ways, which is valuable insight for future improvements or understanding its behavior.\"\n",

    "# Day 5 - Fine-Tuning Frontier LLMs: Challenges & Best Practices for Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text provides a postmortem analysis of a fine-tuning experiment where the fine-tuned model underperformed its baseline on a key business metric, prompting a discussion on the appropriate use cases for fine-tuning powerful frontier models. According to OpenAI, such fine-tuning is best suited for adjusting style/tone, ensuring output format reliability, correcting complex prompt failures, handling edge cases, or teaching new tasks hard to articulate via prompts, rather than general knowledge enhancement, with an emphasis on exhausting prompt engineering first. The audience is then challenged to improve upon the current results by experimenting with data size, hyperparameters, and particularly prompting, followed by a comprehensive recap of the course's progress and a preview of the next module on fine-tuning open-source models using LoRA and QLoRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Fine-Tuning Setback and Leaderboard:** The fine-tuned GPT-4 Mini model achieved a score of 91 on the primary business metric, which was worse than the non-fine-tuned GPT-4 Mini (80) and the leading non-fine-tuned GPT-4 (76), indicating the fine-tuning did not help for this specific metric and setup.\n",

    "    5.  Teaching a **new task** that is difficult to clearly articulate or guide through prompt engineering alone.\n",
    "-   **Prompt Engineering as a First Step:** OpenAI strongly advises prioritizing and maximizing prompt engineering efforts before considering fine-tuning for frontier models, as high performance can often be achieved through sophisticated prompting.\n",
    "-   **Limited Impact on Core Knowledge:** For frontier models already trained on vast datasets (trillions of parameters), adding a relatively small number of fine-tuning examples (e.g., 500) is unlikely to substantially enhance their core world knowledge or reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "-   **Risk of Catastrophic Forgetting:** A potential downside of fine-tuning is \"catastrophic forgetting,\" where the process of learning new specifics can inadvertently erode some of the model's foundational knowledge acquired during pre-training.\n",
    "-   **Rationale for Current Experiment's Outcome:** The speaker suggests the fine-tuning didn't improve the primary metric because the base model already understood the well-crafted prompt and output requirements, and its initial performance was strong.\n",
    "-   **Challenge to Improve Performance:** The audience is encouraged to experiment further by adjusting data size (e.g., 1000-2000 examples), trying different hyperparameters, using varied training data points, and especially by refining the prompts, with the goal of surpassing the current top score of 76.\n",
    "-   **Course Progress Recap (75% Complete):** Key achievements include mastering text/code generation with various models and tools (APIs, Hugging Face, LangChain, RAG), applying a 5-step problem-solving strategy, understanding the critical role of data curation, and gaining experience with both traditional ML and frontier model fine-tuning.\n",

    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Frontier LLMs are already exceptionally capable due to extensive pre-training. Fine-tuning them is a specialized process, distinct from training smaller models from scratch or fine-tuning smaller open-source models to gain general capabilities. For frontier models, fine-tuning is less about teaching new, broad knowledge and more about adapting their existing knowledge to very specific behaviors, styles, or complex instructions that are difficult to achieve consistently through prompt engineering alone.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** Understanding these specific use cases helps organizations decide when to invest in fine-tuning a frontier model. For example, if a business needs an AI to consistently adopt a unique brand personality, generate code in a very specific internal framework, or handle nuanced, multi-step tasks that prompts struggle with, fine-tuning might be justified. It's generally not the first approach for tasks where the model simply lacks domain knowledge (where RAG might be better) or for simple style adjustments manageable by prompts.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Advanced prompt engineering (e.g., chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge injection, few-shot prompting, model evaluation for specific behaviors, and the economics of fine-tuning vs. inference costs with complex prompts.\n",

    "-   **Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** When a pre-trained neural network (like an LLM) is subsequently trained or fine-tuned on a new, often narrower, dataset or task, it can lose some of the information or capabilities it learned during its initial, broader training phase. This phenomenon, \"catastrophic forgetting,\" occurs because the model's weights are adjusted to optimize for the new task, potentially overwriting patterns learned for previous tasks.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This is a significant challenge in scenarios requiring continual learning, where models must adapt to new data or tasks over time without degrading performance on what they've already learned. In the context of LLMs, it means that fine-tuning for a very specific purpose might inadvertently make the model less proficient in general reasoning or other areas it was originally good at, which needs to be considered and tested.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Continual learning methodologies, regularization techniques designed to mitigate forgetting (e.g., Elastic Weight Consolidation - EWC, Learning without Forgetting - LwF), replay-based methods (rehearsing old data), architectural approaches (e.g., expert modules), and understanding the stability-plasticity dilemma in neural network training.\n",

    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Your company needs an LLM to draft legal summaries that always include specific clauses and reference case law in a precise, non-negotiable format. Based on OpenAI's recommended objectives, why would fine-tuning a frontier model be a strong candidate approach, even if prompt engineering gets close?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* Fine-tuning would be a strong candidate because this task aligns directly with OpenAI's objective of \"improving reliably producing a particular type of format, a construct.\" While prompt engineering might get close, the absolute necessity for precise, non-negotiable formatting and inclusion of specific clauses in legal summaries often requires the deeper adaptation that fine-tuning can provide for consistent reliability.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain to a non-technical manager the core reason why adding just 500 product descriptions to fine-tune a model like GPT-4 (trained on internet-scale data) is unlikely to teach it fundamentally new facts about the world or vastly improve its general intelligence?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* \"Imagine GPT-4 as a massive library containing nearly all the books ever written; it already has immense general knowledge. Adding our 500 product descriptions is like adding a few pamphlets to that library. While these pamphlets can help it learn the specific style or details of *our* products, they won't significantly change its overall understanding of the world or its general intelligence, which was built from those millions of 'books'.\"\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** The speaker challenges the audience to improve the model's performance (target score < 76) and mentions that data curation and prompt engineering are key. If you were to focus on data curation for the *next* fine-tuning attempt for this price prediction task, what specific characteristics would you look for in new or existing data points to potentially improve the model beyond just increasing volume?\n",
    "    -   *Answer:* Beyond volume, I would focus on curating data points that cover a wider range of edge cases or ambiguous descriptions where the model previously struggled. I'd also ensure a very clean and consistent formatting of input descriptions and target prices, verify the accuracy of all prices, and potentially add examples that explicitly demonstrate reasoning for items with unusual price determinants, if the model could learn such patterns. Diversity and representativeness of challenging cases would be key.\n"

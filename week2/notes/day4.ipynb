    "# Day 4 - Using AI Tools with LLMs: Enhancing Large Language Model Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This session introduces \"tools,\" which allow LLMs to interact with external functions, enhancing their capabilities. It explains the workflow of defining and using tools, and covers common use cases like data fetching, action execution, calculations, and UI modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛠️ \"Tools\" enable LLMs to access and utilize external functions, expanding their functionality.\n",
    "- 🔄 The workflow involves defining available functions, informing the LLM about them, and handling its requests to use them.\n",
    "- 📊 Common use cases include fetching data, executing actions, performing calculations, and modifying UIs.\n",
    "- 🧠 LLMs can request the execution of specific tools with given inputs, and then use the results to generate responses.\n",
    "- 💡 Using tools is similar to adding dynamic context to prompts, but offers a more structured approach.\n",
    "- ✈️ The session will demonstrate building an airline customer support agent that utilizes tools to provide ticket prices.\n",
    "- 📝 JSON responses can also be used for action execution and UI modification, offering an alternative to tools.\n",

    "# Day 4 - How to Equip LLMs with Custom Tools: OpenAI Function Calling Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This video tutorial explains how to equip a Language Model (LM), specifically GPT-4, with tools to perform specific actions, such as retrieving ticket prices. It demonstrates the process of defining a function as a tool, passing it to the LM, and handling the LM's request to call that tool. The tutorial also provides code examples and explains the message exchange between the user, the LM, and the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛠️ The tutorial focuses on equipping an LM with external tools to expand its capabilities.\n",
    "- 📝 A function is defined as a tool, including its description and parameters.\n",
    "- 🔄 The LM is given the tool, and when needed, it requests to use it through a \"tool calls\" finish reason.\n",
    "- 📦 The arguments for the tool are extracted from the LM's response using JSON parsing.\n",
    "- 📞 The defined tool function is called with the provided arguments.\n",
    "- 💬 The tool's response is formatted as a message with the \"tool\" role and sent back to the LM.\n",
    "- 🚀 The tutorial concludes by suggesting further extensions, like adding booking functionality.\n",

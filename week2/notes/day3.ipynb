    "# Day 3 - Build a Conversational AI Chatbot with OpenAI & Gradio: Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This session demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using OpenAI and Gradio. It explains the structure of prompt messages, the function required for Gradio's chat interface, and how conversation history is managed. It also clarifies how OpenAI handles message structures and converts them into tokens for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🤖 Building a chatbot UI using OpenAI and Gradio's `chatinterface`.\n",
    "- 📝 Understanding the message structure for OpenAI's API: a list of dictionaries with roles like \"system,\" \"user,\" and \"assistant.\"\n",
    "- 🔄 Creating a `chat` function to format conversation history for the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- 💬 Gradio's `chatinterface` expects a function with specific input parameters (message, history).\n",
    "- 🗣️ Demonstrating how conversation context is maintained by passing the entire history to the LLM with each interaction.\n",
    "- 🔑 OpenAI converts message structures into tokens, including special tokens, for the LLM to process.\n",
    "- 🧠 The LLM learns to interpret these special tokens through training on vast amounts of structured data.\n",
